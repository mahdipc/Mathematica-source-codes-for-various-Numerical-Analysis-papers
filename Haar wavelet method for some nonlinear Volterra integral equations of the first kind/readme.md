### Haar wavelet method for some nonlinear Volterra integral
equations of the first kind ###

We present here a simple efficient Haar wavelet method for numerical solution of a class of nonlinear Volterra integral equations of the first kind. The present method is based on converting nonlinear Volterra integral equations of the first kind into linear Volterra integral equations of the second kind. Numerical examples are given to illustrate efficiency and accuracy of the present method. Comparison with numerical methods in the past has also been done.
