We construct a stabilized Runge–Kutta method of Pouzet type (Pouzet–Runge–Kutta–
Chebyshev method, PRKC) for nonlinear stiff Volterra integral equations of the second kind.
The PRKC method is an explicit second-order scheme which possesses extended stability
region due to the first kind Chebyshev polynomial used to establish the stability function.
