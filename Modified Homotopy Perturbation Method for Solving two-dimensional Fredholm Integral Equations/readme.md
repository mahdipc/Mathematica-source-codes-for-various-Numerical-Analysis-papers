# Abstract
In this paper, the analytical approximate solution of the two-dimensional linear
Fredholm integral equations (2DLFIE), is deduced with the help of a modification
of powerful homotopy perturbation method (HPM). Here we consider the 2DLFIE of the second kind with degenerate kernel. Solved examples reveal that the
proposed method is very effective and simple and in most cases, it gives the exact
solution of equations.
