### Legendre wavelets operational method for the numerical
solutions of nonlinear Volterra integro-differential equations
system ###

In this paper, Legendre wavelet method is developed to approximate the solutions of
system of nonlinear Volterra integro-differential equations. The properties of Legendre
wavelets are first presented. The properties of Legendre wavelets are used to reduce the
system of integral equations to a system of algebraic equations which can be solved
numerically by Newtonâ€™s method. Also, the results obtained by present method have been
compared with that of by B-spline wavelet method. Illustrative examples have been
discussed to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the present method.
