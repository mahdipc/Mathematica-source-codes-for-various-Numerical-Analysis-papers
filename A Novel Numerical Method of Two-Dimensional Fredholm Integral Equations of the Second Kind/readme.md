A novel numerical method is developed for solving two-dimensional linear Fredholm integral equations of the second kind by
integral mean value theorem. In the proposed algorithm, each element of the generated discrete matrix is not required to calculate
integrals, and the approximate integral operator is convergent according to collectively compact theory. Convergence and error
analyses of the approximate solution are provided. In addition, an algorithm is given. The reliability and efficiency of the proposed
method will be illustrated by comparison with some numerical results.
